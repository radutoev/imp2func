/*
* Looking for functions that are:
* 1. Total
* 2. Deterministic
* 3. Pure
*
* First step is function composition. For this there are different mechanisms.
* We will focus on `for comprehension` -> Scala's “for comprehensions” are syntactic sugar for composition of multiple operations with foreach , map , flatMap , filter or withFilter . Scala actually translates a for-expression into calls to those methods, so any class providing them, or a subset of them, can be used with for comprehensions.
*
* Pretty much we defer things higher up in the call stack, so a program can be understood higher up.
* Also we need to try to define the function signatures as well as possible.
*
* Examples of functions that do not have the listed attributes:
*
* def println(s: String): Unit = ??? //not pure, as it is interacting with the external word, so Unit not cool
* def readLine(): String = ??? // not deterministic
* */

    * All functions are total now; and nobody has to write the IO stuff etc etc.
    * There are libraries that give you nice tools for dealing with effects.
    * There is something not quite satisfying. -> in the unsafeRun we pass chunks of code and pass them around
    * We don't have the ability to see what's inside of it, plus the chunk of code can contain pretty much anything.
    * And this does not provide the full power of a full functional approach. Our only option is just running it.
    * So there is difficulty in testing it. How are we going to test it?
    * There are also some reasoning problems, because the types that can be passed in the unsafeRun can be pretty much anything.
    * Thus an IO[Unit] can describe any scala code, and thus in order to see what it does we need to look at the implementation.
    * So a solution is to abstract over the IO -> meaning that we need to abstract stuff that "looks" like IO, but which are not IO.
    * Thus we can be more precise when describing the effects.
    * I don't want to get into this now as this advanced topic and the implementation depends a lot on the programming language used.
    * For example in Scala you would need stuff like higher kinded types, which are not present in Java.
